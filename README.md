# PyBer_Analysis

Overview of the analysis:

###### The purpose of this analysis is to identify key ride sharing metrics by type of city  and visualize the total weekly fares based on the city types which will help determine ride affordability  and improve access to ride sharing services.


### Results:

###### Based on city type, the data shows an overall direct relationship between total rides, total drivers, and total fares, and shows an inverse relationship for average fare per ride and per driver.
By reviewing the summary data we can conclude that there are several key findings among which few are listed below:


###### - Urban cities have 4 times more drivers than suburban cities.
###### - Suburban cities have 6 times more drivers than rural with almost 4.5 times more revenue.
###### - Urban cities have the highest rider demand while rural cities have the least.
###### - Rural cities have the highest average fare per ride and driver.
###### - Urban cities have 2.5 more riders than suburban cities

###### The summary data shows a relationship in which fare revenue is higher by city type when there is a larger ratio of drivers to rides.

### Summary:

###### Based on the analysis my business recommendations to Pyber are: 

###### Increasing the amount of drivers in Rural areas to ensure there are enough drivers to meet ride demand. Data for rural cities shows that the average fare per ride and average fare per driver is much higher than Suburban and urban cities. This indicates that rural area based riders are paying much more than the other two city types. The basic economic theory suggests that where there is a higher demand and scares supply, prices usually rise. Prices could also be higher in rural areas due to the distance between destinations. Hence increasing the number of drivers in the rural areas could improves access to transportation and mobility to society in the area, regulate the average fare per ride, and help the company generate higher revenue.  

###### Urban cities have the highest percentage of total fares at 63%.This could be due to many factors including population, infrastructure, vicinity etc. 
Therefore, to give a more definitive recommendation to the CEO would require further analysis where trends can be identified and analyzed considering other factors as well.
